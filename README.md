# Brain-Tumor-Detection-Using-Segmentation
We have used image segmentation to focus on the Area of interest to get near precise results. 
Along with CNN model to automate the process of diagnosis. We tried different Nueral networks and found the best accuracy with Resunet CNN as it combines best with medical image process and overcomes the Vanishing graduent problem that exists in aome other nueral networks.
